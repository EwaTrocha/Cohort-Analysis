# Customer Retention Cohort Analysis

This project analyzes customer retention across weekly cohorts, focusing on trends in customer behavior over time. The goal is to track retention rates, identify top-performing cohorts, and analyze areas for improvement.

## Key Insights from Dashboard

- **Best Performing Cohorts**: 
  - Cohort from **2020-12-20** shows the highest retention across the weeks, with a retention rate of **93.41%** by week 6.
  
- **Retention Decline**:
  - Retention is declining after the first week, with an average retention of **88.65%** by week 6.
  - This indicates a need to focus on keeping customers beyond the first week.

- **Crucial Time for Retention**:
  - The first week is crucial in maintaining customer engagement, as retention drops significantly after week 1 (from **100%** to **95.35%** on average).

- **Top Cohorts**:
  - The **2020-12-27** cohort has the best first-week retention of **96.88%**, but like other cohorts, retention begins to decline after that.

## Visualizations

- **Retention by Cohort**: A heatmap showing retention percentages week over week for each cohort.
- **Average Retention Over Weeks**: A line chart showing average retention across all cohorts, highlighting the sharp drop after the first week.
- **First Week Retention**: A chart focusing on first-week retention trends, with a peak in retention for the **2020-12-20** cohort.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on the First Week**: Since retention tends to drop significantly after week 1, it is crucial to engage customers more during this time to increase retention in the following weeks.
   
2. **Analyze Best Cohorts**: Investigate what attracted customers in high-performing cohorts (e.g., 2020-12-20) and apply these strategies to other cohorts.
   
3. **Stabilize Retention**: Work on strategies to stabilize retention over time, as average retention shows a declining trend over the weeks.
